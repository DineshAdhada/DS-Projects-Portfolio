    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with SQL is a method used to combine natural language processing (NLP) models, like GPT, with structured query retrieval from databases using SQL (Structured Query Language). The goal is to leverage both the power of language models to understand and generate human-like text and the accuracy of SQL queries to retrieve data from structured sources, like relational databases."
